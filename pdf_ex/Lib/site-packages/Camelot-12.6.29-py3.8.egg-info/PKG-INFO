        Camelot provides components for building business applications on top of **Python**, **SQLAlchemy** and **Qt**.  
        It is inspired by the Django admin interface.  
        A simple piece of code as this::
        
          class Task( Entity ):
              short_description = Column( Unicode( 60 ), nullable = False )
              due_date = Column( Date() )
              long_description = Column( RichText() )
          
              class Admin( EntityAdmin ):
                  list_display = ['short_description', 'due_date']
              
        Is enough to define your database schema, define the mapping between the
        database and objects, and to create a user friendly desktop GUI.
        
        Building applications with Camelot has these advantages :
        
          *  Use high quality editors together with the *Qt* Model-View framework
          
          *  Editors are bound to the model without writing binding code
          
          *  User friendliness and performance out of the box
          
          *  Tons of built in functions such as data import and export, printing, 
             backup and restore
             
          *  Documentation on creating the various parts of an application like wizards
             and reports
